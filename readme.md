Arduino_Pro_Mini_PTH
====================

Crazy stupid experiment to see how close you can get to an 
[Arduino Pro Mini](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardProMini) using 
through hole parts.

Made with [KiCad](http://www.kicad-pcb.org/), which is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software](free and open source software).
No raptors were touched in the making of this board.

No, I haven't built it (yet?).
